One of my first multi-file programming projects.

It basically decimates every single one of the tests in [https://humanbenchmark.com/](https://humanbenchmark.com/). 

From the README.md:

- Aim Trainer (Top 99.9%) - Best score: 26ms
- Number Memory (Top 100%) - Best score: ∞
- Sequence Memory (Top 100%) - Best score: ∞
- Verbal Memory (Top 100) - Best score: ∞
- Visual Memory (Top 100%) - Best score: ∞
- Reaction Time (Top 99.9%) - Best score: 28ms
- Typing Test (Top 100%) - Best score: 8200 WPM
- Chimp Test (Top 100%) - Best score: 41(max) in 33.864s


## The Development

I only spent 5 days working on the project, however I spent countless hours on it, including a lot of school classes. Just like most of the other programming projects that you see here, they are the result of short bursts of obsession over the implementation of an idea.

I already knew the basics of webscraping, or at least the basics to do this comfortably, and this is mainly why I went for this. Also, I used to compete with my friend in this website (he beat me in almost everything) and so I decided that if I coldn't beat him, a bot could.

Once I had completed the implementation for all the tests in the website I tried to control everything from a single file, to enable ease of use.

On the later stages of the project I tried searching for other implementiations of what I wanted to do. I wasn't very happy with the speed and so I found other repos that did basically the same as I wanted to do. Thanks to [Alorans](https://github.com/alorans/AutoHumanBenchmark) for making my code faster in some tests.

## Conclusion

All in all, it was a comfort zone project that was really fun to do. I didn't learn much from it but it was cool nontheless. 10/10 would recommend if you are looking into webscraping as it's very entry-level friendly and it's also very fun to see you decimate the results of your tryhard friends. :)
