This was yet another of my C++ practice projects.

It generates a simple maze and it is somewhat configurable.

I have plans to re-write it in C (shouldn't be too complicated) and optimize it for speed. This will hopefully teach me more about algorythms. 

My current speed goal is for it to complete a 40x40 maze in less than 1 ms without taking into account the time to "draw" it in the terminal.
