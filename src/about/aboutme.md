I'm an aerospace student that is more invested into programming than it should.

On my way to accomplish goals I get distracted by the small rabbit holes near my path. I just can't help it, they are so appealing. Frequently, it's just small peeks, but sometimes I stumble and fall deeper into those unknown worlds and get lost in their novelty and intricacy.

And I think that's beautiful. I reckon that's how life is meant to be lived. Exploring every last bit you can, getting sidetracked by all it's alternatives paths without knowing where they could lead you.

This is the reason why I have so many hobbies and so many difficulties managing my time to give them all some love. If you want to know more about my hobbies, you can find a 30 second long presentation of them in the [home page](/)
